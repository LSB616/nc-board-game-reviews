## **Initial Setup**

### **.env files**

You will need to create two .env files in order to successfully connect the two databases locally: .env.test and .env.development. 

### *Creating the .env files*

To create those files either click the new file button at the top of the explorer side bar or right click in the explorer bar and click New File. Alternatively type into the console 'touch .env.test' and 'touch .env.development' which will create the files for you.

### *What to add into the .env files*

Into the .env.test file add PGDATABASE=nc_games_test and into the .env.development file add PGDATABASE=nc_games. Save and close the files.
